#  Processes and signals
## About
Bash project:
A process can be thought of as an instance of a program in execution. We called this an ‘instance of a program’, because if the same program is run lets say 10 times then there will be 10 corresponding processes.
The syntax for this loop is:

for NAME [in LIST ]; do COMMANDS; done
