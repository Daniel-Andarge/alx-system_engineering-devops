# Project 0x06. Regular expression ðŸ“š

### ðŸ“‹ Requirements
***
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`,`emacs`.
* Files will be interpreted on Ubuntu `20.04` LTS.
* All your Bash script files must be executable.
* All your regex must be built for the Oniguruma library.

### ðŸŽ¯ Tasks
***

Using the project instructions, create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method.

#### Mandatory:
| Files | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [0-simply_match_school.rb](https://github.com/Daniel-Andarge/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x06-regular_expressions/) | The regular expression must match `School`. |
| [1-repetition_token_0.rb](https://github.com/Daniel-Andarge/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x06-regular_expressions/1-repetition_token_0.rb) | Repetition Token `#0`. Find the regular expression that will match the above cases. |
| [2-repetition_token_1.rb](https://github.com/Daniel-Andarge/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x06-regular_expressions/2-repetition_token_1.rb) | Repetition Token `#1`. Find the regular expression that will match the above cases. |
| [3-repetition_token_2.rb](https://github.com/Daniel-Andarge/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x06-regular_expressions/3-repetition_token_2.rb) | Repetition Token `#2`. Find the regular expression that will match the above cases. |
| [4-repetition_token_3.rb](https://github.com/Daniel-Andarge/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x06-regular_expressions/4-repetition_token_3.rb) | Repetition Token `#3`. Find the regular expression that will match the above cases. |
| [5-beginning_and_end.rb](https://github.com/Daniel-Andarge/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x06-regular_expressions/5-beginning_and_end.rb) | The regular expression must be exactly matching a string that starts with h ends with n and can have any single character in between. |
| [6-phone_number.rb](https://github.com/Daniel-Andarge/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x06-regular_expressions/6-phone_number.rb) | The regular expression must match a 10 digit phone number. |
| [7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb](https://github.com/Daniel-Andarge/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x06-regular_expressions/7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb) | The regular expression must be only matching: capital letters. |

#### Advanced:
| Files | Description |
