# Firewall

In this project, I used `ufw` to configure firewalls on my issued web servers.

## Tasks

* **0. Block all incoming traffic but**
  * [0-block_all_incoming_traffic_but](./1-block_all_incoming_traffic_but): Bash
  script that installs a `ufw` firewall to block all incoming traffic except for
  ports `22`, `443` and `80` on a web server.
